## ❓ Why can’t you play directly on GitHub Pages?

Unity WebGL build uses **Brotli compression**. GitHub Pages doesn’t send the correct HTTP headers (`Content-Encoding: br`), so the game fails to load.
➡ **Solution:** Hosted on **itch.io** where correct headers are served.

---

### ✅ **So you can:**

* **Play on itch.io** (recommended): https://midhan.itch.io/the-beast-at-the-back
* Use **GitHub Pages ONLY for leaderboard**
